    "The Rainfall problem has a long history, see this [review](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288002756_Do_we_know_how_difficult_the_Rainfall_Problem_is) for details.  The problem involves combining structural components of programming, e.g. loops and conditionals to calculate the mean of a data set subject to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ignoring negative values\n",
    "2. Exiting and calculating the mean early if a certain `STOP` value is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will modify a provided function to meet these criteria where the `STOP` value is `99`.  You will also handle exceptions such as empty lists and related problems to improve the robustness of you function and provide informative messages and help to potential users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the exercise you will introduce the possibility of a user defined `STOP` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to monitor your progress by comparing how your functions pass a series of tests provided in the exercise repository.  This also includes a prototype function to help you get started.  "

Open `test_enhanced.py` and reconstruct what it is doing in a flow chart, or with code, the documentation and comments in the function should help you to understand how it is operating.  See if you can identify what is wrong and propose a fix.\n",
