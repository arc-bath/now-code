    "## Information: Python virtual environments\n",
    "\n",
    "We found last week that having the wrong version of Python (i.e. not Python 3) can cause problems due to the different operationis of programs.  Fortunately `Python` provides the means to manage this issue through the creation of environments using the `[mini]conda` package manager.  This also allows us to install the libraries we need for our different programs and keep them separate in case the cause conflits or use different versions of libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a new environment with the following:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% conda create -n python3 python=3.7\n",
    "```\n",
    "Answer `y` at the prompt to create the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt advises us to activate our new environment with:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% conda activate python3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On 'linux.bath' when returning to the environment you may have to use the command`source activate python3`.  Recall that the problem last week was that we did not have the correct version of `pytest` available, so we will install this to our new environment, we also want to use `ipython3` by default.  Note that in order to this you have to activate the environment as above.  Your prompt will now be prefixed with the name of the environment:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(python3) % conda install pytest\n",
    "...\n",
    "(python3) % conda install ipython\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Again you will need to answer `y` to install when prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where necessary the exercises comprising `now-code` should advise you if you need to install specific additional libraries or packages .  When they do, or if packages are not present you should be able to install them to your environment using `conda install <library>`.  If not you can try `pip install <library>`  You can `create` and `remove` conda environments so feel free to investigate further after the workshop."

    "## Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "So far the example we have undertaken have been relatively short due to time constraints.  This means that we have generally not spent too long planning our code, however for anything but the simplest programs this can be a mistake.  Writing pseduocode or flowcharts can help us to understand what our program needs to do.  When we have more significant programming challenges it can also help us to break down the code into functions and architect the different components that we will need to include.\n",

    "    count items in list\n",
    "    return mean: sum/count\n",

    "def mean(sample):\n",
    "    '''\n",
    "    Takes a list of numbers, sample\n",

    "    and returns the mean.\n",
    "    '''\n",
    "\n",
    "    assert len(sample) != 0, \"Unable to take the mean of an empty list\"\n",
    "    for value in sample:\n",
    "        assert isinstance(value,int) or isinstance(value,float), \"Value in list is not a number.\"\n",
    "    sample_mean = sum(sample) / len(sample)\n",

    "\n",
    "In professional development practices such as code review and pair programming are used to ensure quality, develop understanding and provide mentoring. During these exercises you are encouraged to work with a neighbour.  Develop your pseudocode together to plan how you are going to tackle the problem.  When you start coding one of your will **drive** or **pilot**, explaining what you are doing when appropriate, and the other will **navigate** or **guide**, as necessary.  Both should understand what and why you are doing what you are doing at all times.\n",

    "```\n",
