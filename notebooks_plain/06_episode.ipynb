You should find that is taking several seconds to run, once you have around 1000 values in each direction.  At this point it becomes a bit boring to sit around waiting for our code to run, and these are still quite small images with low definition, also we would like to increase the maximum number of iterations we can run our code for.\n",

This simplest and one of the most effective is to import one function and add two lines of code to our functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to import from the `numba` library: `from numba import jit` and add the line `@jit` before each of your two functions.  Re-run your function with these changes and see how long the code now takes to run.\n",

    "If you explore the link above and the original blog article it references the plotting function: `plt.imshow(mandel,cmap='hot', norm=colors.PowerNorm(0.3), interpolation='none')`, which you can use to plot a more attractive plot, to use this as written you will also need to import the `colors` library from matplotlib."
