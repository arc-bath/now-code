If neither is passed your function should work as before returning all the substrings as before.  If either (or both) is provided by the user these should be used as the `start` and `stop` indices of the list of substrings returned by your function.  As with normal `Python` behaviour when slicing lists, your user should understand that if provided the `start` index will be the first returned, and `stop` the first not returned and this should be reflected in your documentation.\n",
